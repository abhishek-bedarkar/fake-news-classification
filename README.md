# Decoding Deception: A Fake News Classification Project

### Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a Fake News Classification project. The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate various machine-learning models for distinguishing between real and fake news articles.


## ðŸ›  Skills
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), NLTK, TensorFlow

## Steps Performed

[Fake news Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification)

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Inspect ratio of real and fake news
- Drop extra unnamed column
- Handle Missing value
- Explore the trend in article length and news category
- Word Cloud for news titles

2. Data Processing: Preprocessed the data to prepare it for model training, including cleaning and handling missing values.

3. Modeling: Implemented various machine learning algorithms for classification:
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Network using Tokenization and Padding
- Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
